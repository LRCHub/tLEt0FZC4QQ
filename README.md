# GIVĒON – At Least We Tried

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
I know I had said
this was one thing
Two hands on the wheel,
that's how we cruise
How'd I lose control
and end up falling?
Guess you got in my head
before I knew, knew
Running around it
but when did we cross the line?
Running around it,
I know that it crossed your mind
Me too, babe, might lose but if
It don't work, at least we tried
Never know till you let me in
Can't let it go
'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work,
at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end,
I still wanna say
At least we tried (We tried)
Tried
We both understand this may
not work
It's clear we both agree
but here right now
Don't make a sound
and let's just
Wait for that day to come
Till then, I'm all yours
Just make me love you
I can't get this feeling
out my heart
Without
Running around it
but when did we cross the line?
(Running around it, around it)
Running around it, I know that
it crossed your mind
Me too, babe, might lose but if
It don't work, at least we tried
Never know till you let me in
Can't let it go
'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work,
at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end,
I still wanna say
At least we tried (We tried)
Tried
Which way we play it?
It is what we make it
What are we waiting for?
'Cause I know
there's something more with you
Even exchanges give some
to take it
Maybe it's right,
maybe it's wrong
At the end of the night if
It don't work, at least we tried
Never know till you let me in
Can't let it go
'cause you back again
Wondering if this don't work,
at least we tried
Love is always a losing game
But in the end,
I still wanna say
At least we tried (We tried)
Tried
